Stir briskly. The ideal consistency is similar to condensed milk. Add more milk or water if the batter seems too thick. Put a little butter or oil in the frying pan and heat over the stove. Test the heat of the pan with a couple drops of water. When a drop of water \u201cdances\u201d in the oil you can turn the heat down as low as possible and begin pouring pancake batter. Stir well before pouring each pancake.  Pour small amounts of batter from bowl. When lots of bubbles form and the pancake looks firm around the edges you can flip it. Be patient. If you don\u2019t have a spatula try using two forks. If you don\u2019t have maple syrup, these are good with lemon and powdered sugar or jam. \n",
