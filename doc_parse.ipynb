        "\n",
        "One of the benefits of being a volunteer is that, in most situations, you will be cooking for yourself only.  There will be no one to criticize your gregarious use of spice or your preference for food burnt beyond recognition.  Abandon the fear of throwing things together and seeing how it turns out.  You have time to experiment, after all.  \n",

        "If you are going to eat fruit or vegetables raw, soak them for 15 minutes in a solution of 1-tablespoon bleach in one gallon of water.  Rinse with treated water.  Fruits and vegetables that are to be boiled or peeled do not require treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meat needs to be thoroughly cooked with no trace of pink to kill all bacteria and parasites.  After preparing meat, be sure to wash all areas the meat has touched (e.g. a cutting board) with the same bleach solution described above.\n",

        "\n",
        "As Volunteers and HIV/AIDS educators, there are limits to how medically involved we can be with the health concerns of the people in our communities.  However, thre is one area we can make a difference and it is simply giving advice to Swazis about nutrition by giving health talks at the clinics, building gardens and so forth.  Good nutrition is one of the most important components in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Any practitioner at the Baylor Pediatric AIDS Hospital or MSF / Doctors Without Borders will attest to this statement.  Diet is essential to helping people (HIV positive or not) remain well and happy.  Many Swazis believe that only ARVs can help them fight HIV/AIDS, but in reality, food plays an indispensable role in rebuilding the human body.  Food can help increase CD4 counts, fight TB and/or delay the onset of taking ARVs.  This section will help you learn the basic approach to a healthy and balanced diet.\n",
        "\n",
        "There seems to be many factors that help people with HIV to live long lives:  The belief that they will survive, support from family and friends, little stress, enough money, low exposure to the virus, early medical treatment for infections, traditional medical treatment, gentle exercise and eating healthy are some of these factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Food is a form of medication that is cheap and easy to attain.  It takes time and patience to see the benefits of good food.  By eating foods that heal the body, you are choosing to live a stronger and healthier life.  Exercise is also an important part of this equation.  Combining a healthy diet with exercise helps persons living with HIV to improve their life.\n",

        "Digestion begins in the mouth, so remember to eat slowly and chew your food well. Listen to your body. It can tell you what it needs. If you feel uncomfortable after eating a particular kind of food, then it is better not to eat it. Listen to your body, love and nourish it.\n",

        "\n",
        "Fruit\n",
        "Fruit is easy to digest and contains natural sugars as well as many vitamins and minerals. Steam and mash fruit if you have sores in your mouth or your body is cold. Eat what is freshest and in season. Fruit cleans the inside of the body. Dried fruit is rich in nutrients, easy to digest and good for gaining weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grains\n",
        "Grains build the body and contain important vitamins and minerals. Eat a variety of grains such as rice, maize, millet, sorghum, oats, barley, wheat, and rye. Grains combined with legumes, milk and animal products add protein to the diet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Refined maize meal only contains starch, so choose to eat un-sifted maize meal, maize kernels or maize rice. \n",
        "Sugars\n",
        "\n",
        "Sugars that are natural or unrefined, such as honey and molasses, also contain minerals and vitamins. Eat sugars in small amounts, however, or you may have problems with candida, which is a fungus that feeds off sugars. Candida, which is also called thrush or yeast, infects that mouth, digestive tract and vagina. Avoid sugar if you have candida. Too much sugar damages the body and stops the immune system from working properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fats and Oils\n",
        "Fats and oils are good sources of energy. They help the body to absorb some of the vitamins. The body uses fat to make other chemicals that it needs to work properly.\n",
        "Fats and oils are good for gaining weight. Good sources of fat and oil are meat, chicken, coconut, avocado, peanut butter, olives, seeds and nuts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Do not use large amounts of processed cooking oil and fat because it stresses the immune system. Butter is preferable to margarine because it is not processed.  Excess fat also causes heart, liver and digestive problems. Diarrhea can be worsened, or be caused, by too much fat. Do no eat a lot of fried foods.  If you have problems with digesting fats, add fresh lemon juice or the grated skin of oranges or lemons to your food. The skin contains pectin, which helps with fat absorption.\n",

        "Various Foods \n",
        "\n",
        "GARLIC\n",
        "Garlic strengthens the immune system. It helps fight infections caused by viruses, bacteria and fungi. Eat garlic every day to prevent and fight the infections that come with HIV/AIDS. Please note that garlic can interact with some ARV drugs so make sure to check with your doctor or check the labels on your medications.  \n",
        "\n",
        "YOGURT\n",
        "Yogurt is made by adding certain body-friendly bacteria to milk. The bacteria change the milk into yogurt. When eaten, these body-friendly bacteria live in the intestines and complete with a range of microorganisms that can cause disease in the intestinal tract. Yogurt is often digestible for those who cannot digest other milk products.  By eating yogurt daily, you can help to prevent diseases like diarrhea and candida. Yogurt is a good source of protein as well as the minerals calcium, potassium, phosphorus and B vitamins. \n",
        "Antibiotics, the medicines that kill bacteria, destroy the good as well as the bad bacteria in the body. It is especially important to eat yogurt when you are taking antibiotics, so as to replace good bacteria.  Buy unsweetened plain yogurt because candida feeds off sugar. Add your own fruit and nuts if you do not like plain yogurt.\n",
        "\n",
        "LEMONS\n",
        "Lemons stimulate the liver, clean the digestive tract and help prevent infections. They aid digestion, especially of proteins and fats. The skin of lemons and oranges contains pectin which helps the body absorb fats and oils and, therefore, to gain weight.\n",
        "Put grated lemon skin or fresh lemon juice over fatty foods such as chicken, meat, fried foods and nuts to help gain weight. Lemon juice in hot water first thing in the morning improves digestion and cleans and stimulates the liver. Use only fresh lemons but do not use too much. If you drink lemon juice regularly, drink it through a straw to protect your teeth, and do not drink orange juice as the body may turn it into acid. Drink milk to balance the acidity of the lemons.\n",
        "\n",
        "FERMENTED FOODS\n",
        "Foods, like sour milk and sour porridge, which are left to stand for a period of time before they are eaten, are called fermented foods. These foods are commonly found in Africa. Fermenting changes the taste and nutrient content of foods and helps to preserve them. Special harmless bacteria multiply in the food before or after cooking. They change some of the starch and sugar in the food to a weak acid that gives the food a sour taste.\n",
        "Fermenting makes the food easier to digest. Fermented foods are also a source of friendly flora, which further help digestion. They are good for all digestive problems especially diarrhea, candida (thrush) and weight gain.  Harmful bacteria cannot multiply easily in sour fermented food, so these foods remain safe to eat for longer than fresh foods do. \n",
        "\n",
        "FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\n",
        "All fruit and vegetables are healthy foods. Eat wild indigenous fruit and vegetables as well as those you buy in markets and shops.\n",

        "CABBAGE\n",
        "Cabbage has been shown to help prevent cancer, control infections and heal ulcers. It strengthens the immune system. You can use the leaves for external inflammation of the skin and eyes. Cabbage contains calcium, vitamins A and C and sulfur. It is best to eat it raw. \n",
        "\n",
        "CARROTS\n",
        "Carrots are high in beta-carotene; B vitamins; vitamins C, D, E and K; and the minerals iron, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur and copper. The body changes beta-carotene into vitamin A, which is an important antioxidant. Carrots are useful for treating skin and eye problems. You can eat carrots raw, as part of mixed vegetable dishes or as soup. \n",
